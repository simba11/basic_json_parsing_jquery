# Welcome Wagon

Your program must output, to stdout, the answer to the following question:

"What is the meaning of life?"

If you are unsure of how to proceed, you can simply look on the internet
for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything;
after all, someone has to have figured it out by now. 

That is all.
